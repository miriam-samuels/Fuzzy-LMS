HAVE METHODS TO FUZZIFY EACH INPUT 
INFERENCE




FUZZIFICATION THOUGHT PATTERNS
(1)
USING LINEAR LINE GRAPHS
y = mx + c (linear equation for a straight line where m = slope / gradinet and c = intercept / starting point and y = degree of membership)
When ploted the degree of bad to rating is decreasing in a straight line
since it's a decreasing slope  m is negative (-m) ... m = change in y (y2-y1) / change in x(x2-x1) (rise / run)
y intercept(y co-ordinate when x is 0 vice versa)..(x1,y1)(x2,y2)

fuck all this shit 

just use the membership functions 


now we have successfully fuziffied our data
apply fuzzy operator to input in order to aggregate them 

AND methods are supported: 
min (minimum of a,b,c,d,e) ... take the minimum of the value of the membership group
prod (product of x,y,z) .... multiply them
OR methods are supported: 
max (maximum) ... take the maximum of the value of the membership group
probor (probabilistic OR) .... probor(a,b,c) = a + b + c - abc
NOT methods are supported: 
NOT a ... 1.0 - a
