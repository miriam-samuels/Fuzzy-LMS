You are proably wondering why i encapsulated ..... i just thought those methods were not needed by other components

GET DATA
HAVE METHODS TO FUZZIFY EACH INPUT 
INFERENCE




FUZZIFICATION THOUGHT PATTERNS
(1)
USING LINEAR LINE GRAPHS
y = mx + c (linear equation for a straight line where m = slope / gradinet and c = intercept / starting point and y = degree of membership)
When ploted the degree of bad to rating is decreasing in a straight line
since it's a decreasing slope  m is negative (-m) ... m = change in y (y2-y1) / change in x(x2-x1) (rise / run)
y intercept(y co-ordinate when x is 0 vice versa)..(x1,y1)(x2,y2)

MY HEAD IS ACHING....

fuck all this shit 

just use the membership functions 


INFERENCE THOUGHT PATTERN
now we have successfully fuziffied our data
apply fuzzy operator to input in order to aggregate them 

AND methods are supported: 
min (minimum of a,b,c,d,e) ... take the minimum of the value of the membership group
where a,b,c,d,e are the input variables
prod (product of x,y,z) .... multiply them
OR methods are supported: 
max (maximum) ... take the maximum of the value of the membership group
probor (probabilistic OR) .... probor(a,b,c) = a + b + c - abc
NOT methods are supported: 
NOT a ... 1.0 - a


AGGREGATE ALL OUTPUTS
if we are using mamdani method we probably want to use max/min method to aggregate
but if you choose to use sugeno then use sum method
i'm thinking of trying bot just the get the diffrnce in results 
In the Mamdani method, the output of a fuzzy rule is a fuzzy set, and these fuzzy sets are combined to generate a fuzzy output.
In the Sugeno method, the output of a fuzzy rule is a linear function.
