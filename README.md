# FUZZY LOGIC LOAN EVALUATION

This project is an MVP for a Loan management system using fuzzy logic for decision support to assess borrowers to make loan decisions. 

It uses 5 inputs for the fuzzy model (annual income, credit score, loan amount, criminal record and collateral) 

The output is the degree of creditworthiness of the borrower.

The heart of this code base is the fuzzy engine
